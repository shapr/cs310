cs310 assembly language and org-mode notes

If you happen to be learning IBM System 360 or System 360 Basic Assembly Language, I strongly recommend that you download and read the following publications:

* IBM System/360 Principles of Operation (IBM document A22-6821)
* A Programmer's Introduction to IBM System/360 Assembler Language (IBM document SC20-1646)

You can find these and more on archive.org in the bitsavers_ibm collection.
or possibly you can browse http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/ibm/360/
(many props to Ehud Lamm for pointing me to these)

I'm using SC20-1646-6 from August 1970 and A22-6821-7 from December 1967, the number at the end appears to be the version number, use the most recent version you can find.
